  "description": "Translucent white to colorless phenakite showing a blocky, prismatic habit with subtle longitudinal striations and a vitreous to slightly greasy luster. Phenakite is a beryllium silicate typically occurring in granitic pegmatites and hydrothermal veins; pieces may appear massive or as short prisms when crystal faces are incomplete.",
