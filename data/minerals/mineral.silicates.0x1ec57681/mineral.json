  "common_name": "Chrysocolla",
  "description": "Blue-green, earthy to slightly waxy copper-bearing silicate coating and filling vugs on a brown, iron-oxide-rich host rock. The massive, porous texture and turquoise-green coloration are consistent with chrysocolla commonly formed in the oxidized zone of copper deposits, sometimes intergrown with quartz/opal and minor malachite.",

  "notes": "Chrysocolla is compositionally variable and often mixed with quartz/opal; hardness can range ~2–4 depending on silica content. Brown areas likely limonite/goethite or iron-stained rock; green may include minor malachite. Streak typically pale blue-green to white.",
